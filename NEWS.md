## New Features
- Added a "Report a bug" link to `{datacutr}` website (#182)

## Updates of Existing Functions
- Update to `impute_dcutdtc()`, `date_cut()` and `special_dm_cut()` functions to allow for 
datacut date to be null. In this case, all records for this patient 
will be kept/left unchanged. (#179, #189, #190)
- Warning added to `process_cut` if expected dataset `dm` is missing (#172)
- Warning added to `create_dcut` if cut date being passed as `NULL`, 
and not valid date or `NA`/`""` (#181)
- `process_cut` updated so that the `patient_cut_v`, `date_cut_m` and `no_cut_v`
arguments have a default value of `NULL` (#188)
- `process_cut` updated to have more detailed error messages when incorrect datasets 
are fed in (#180)
- `process_cut` updated to have arguments `read_out` and `out_path` to integrate the `read_out` function into the wrapper function; enabling auto-generation of the datacutr read-out file (#107)
