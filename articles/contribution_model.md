# Contribution to {datacutr}

## Introduction

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution
model. The goal is to enable users of
[datacutr](https://pharmaverse.github.io/datacutr/) to contribute and
test the contribution model for
[datacutr](https://pharmaverse.github.io/datacutr/). Adjustments might
be made over time.

## Basics

- For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab
  on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datacutr/issues) to put it
  in our backlog.

- All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datacutr/issues)
  will be reviewed and the creator will receive an initial feedback via
  a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new
  issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so
  we can easily identify new requests).

## Contribution Model

- First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to
  notify that they’d like to contribute enhancements to
  [datacutr](https://pharmaverse.github.io/datacutr/).

- A [datacutr](https://pharmaverse.github.io/datacutr/) core development
  team member will be in touch to discuss next steps.
